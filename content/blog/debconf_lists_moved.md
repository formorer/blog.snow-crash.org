title: debconf mailinglists moved to lists.debian.org
---

Today I had the pleasure to move the debconf mailinglists to lists.debian.org. 
That means that the following mailinglists:


* [debconf-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debconf-announce/)
* [debconf-discuss](https://lists.debian.org/debconf-discuss/)
* [debconf-team](https://lists.debian.org/debconf-team/)
* [debconf-video](https://lists.debian.org/debconf-video/)

are now hosted on [lists.debian.org](https://lists.debian.org). Please update
any documentation or bookmarks you have. 

Next step would be to join debconf again ;).
