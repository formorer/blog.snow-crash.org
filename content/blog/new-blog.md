After a long time I decided to move my blog again to
something with git and markdown in the background.

I decided to give [hugo](https://gohugo.io) a chance on my [uberspace](https://www.uberspace.de) account. 

Uberspace is a nice, geek driven hoster in germany from geeks for geeks.

The blog itself is hosted on [github](https://github.com/formorer/blog.snow-crash.org), it pushes commits to a simple golang based webhook service based on [adnanh/webhook](https://github.com/adnanh/webhook).
