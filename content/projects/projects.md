There are some projects where I am involved in, this list probably isn't very complete.
You can find some of my stuff in my [Github account](https://github.com/formorer).

**[Debian](https://www.debian.org)**

I am a Debian Developer since 2003 and (co-)maintain several packages like [Icinga](https://www.icinga.org), [Iproute](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/networking/iproute2), 
[Ferm](http://ferm.foo-projects.org/) and other stuff. I am also a [Listmaster](https://lists.debian.org) and [Alioth](https://alioth.debian.org).

**[GRML](https://www.grml.org)**

I am a member of the [GRML](https://www.grml.org) where I mostly do infrastructure things.

Debmon is one of my projects where I (and others) do provide monitoring related packages for Debian.
